Hi, my name is Andreas Pauley.

I like the elegance and predictability of programming in a functional style.

There are lots of programmers that are smarter and more experienced than me in functional programming. But I tricked the best of these into [meeting up every month][luminaries] in order to milk their minds :-)

Currently I work as a Scala developer.
Previously I worked in dev teams using various programming languages,
including Erlang, Smalltalk and Python.
